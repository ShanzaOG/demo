# demo
This project is an Introduction to SpringBoot v3.0.4
All requests(GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) are working fine as I've tested them using Postman
The only thing that is work in progress is working with a real database because I was using Postman to test my requests.
The next step is intergrating a real database and deloying the API to a server so that it can be accessed by multiple clients from anywhere.
